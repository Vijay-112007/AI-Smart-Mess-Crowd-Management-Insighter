## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam or video file for testing
- Firebase account (free tier is sufficient)
- Minimum 4GB RAM (for YOLOv8 model)
- Internet connection (for Firebase sync)

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### **Step 1: Firebase Configuration**

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This step is mandatory for the application to function properly.

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Click "Add Project" and follow the setup wizard
   - Enable **Realtime Database** in your project

2. **Generate Private Key**:
   - Navigate to **Project Settings** (gear icon) → **Service Accounts**
   - Click **Generate New Private Key**
   - Download the JSON file (e.g., `newrulesimportant.json`)

3. **Configure the Application**:
   - Place the downloaded JSON file in the project root directory
   - Ensure the filename matches the one referenced in the code: `newrulesimportant.json`
   - Update the database URL in [main.py](main.py) if different:
     ```python
     database_url = "https://your-project-id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/"
     ```

4. **Database Rules** (Optional - for testing):
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       ".read": true,
       ".write": true
     }
   }
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Install all required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python firebase-admin
```

**Package Details**:
- `ultralytics` - YOLOv8 object detection framework
- `opencv-python` - Computer vision and video processing
- `firebase-admin` - Firebase Realtime Database SDK

---

### **Step 3: Project Setup**

> 📁 **Important**: Clone/download the entire project directory to avoid path-related issues.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Vijay-112007/AI-Smart-Mess-Crowd-Management-Insighter.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd AI-Smart-Mess-Crowd-Management-Insighter

# Verify directory structure
ls -la
```

**Expected Directory Structure**:
```
AI-Smart-Mess-Crowd-Management-Insighter/
│
├── main.py                          # Main application entry point
├── newrulesimportant.json          # Firebase credentials (you need to add this)
├── README.md                        # Project documentation
├── SECURITY.md                      # Security guidelines
│
├── assets/
│   ├── yolov8n.pt                  # YOLOv8 nano model (lightweight)
│   ├── yolov8l.pt                  # YOLOv8 large model (higher accuracy)
│   └── Dining_Hall_Queue_Video_Generation.mp4  # Demo video
│
├── data/

└── src/
    ├── authentication.py           # User authentication module
    ├── crowd.py                    # Crowd analytics engine
    └── mail.py                     # Email notification module
```

---

### **Step 4: Run the Application**

```bash
python main.py
```

**First-time Setup**:
1. Choose option **1** (Sign Up) to create an account
2. Select user type (Admin or User)
3. Provide credentials and email
4. Follow the on-screen menu options

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### **1. Authentication System**

The application uses a secure authentication mechanism defined in [authentication.py](src/authentication.py):

- **SignUp Class**: Registers new users (Admin/User) with credentials stored in CSV files
- **SignIn Class**: Validates existing user credentials
- **Role-based Access**: Different privileges for Admin and User roles

After successful authentication, users are presented with role-specific options.

---

### **2. User Roles & Features**

#### 👤 **User Portal**
Available options after login:
1. **Crowd Analytics** - View real-time mess queue status
2. **Scan QR** - Quick check-in feature *(Coming Soon)*
3. **Food Insights** - Nutritional information and menu *(Coming Soon)*
4. **Exit** - Logout from the system

#### 👨‍💼 **Admin Portal**
Available options after login:
1. **Crowd Analytics** - Monitor real-time mess queue with detailed stats
2. **Generate QR Code** - Create unique QR codes for students *(Coming Soon)*
3. **Food Insights** - Manage menu and dietary information *(Coming Soon)*
4. **Monthly Insights** - Analytics dashboard and reports *(Coming Soon)*
5. **Exit** - Logout from the system

> **Note**: QR code scanning, food insights, and monthly analytics features are fully developed but not integrated into this repository due to code dependency issues with the deployment pipeline. A complete demonstration video showcasing all features will be provided separately.

---

### **3. Crowd Analytics Engine**

The core analytics functionality is implemented in [crowd.py](src/crowd.py):

#### **Video Processing**:
- Uses **YOLOv8n model** (`yolov8n.pt`) for person detection
- Processes video frames at standard resolution (720x640)
- Real-time object detection with confidence threshold filtering

#### **Intelligent Counting**:
- **Masked Zone Detection**: Automatically identifies service area (using bowl/spoon detection)
- **Staff Exclusion**: Service personnel behind the masked zone are excluded from counts
- **Live Count**: Current number of people in the queue
- **Peak Count**: Maximum crowd density during the session

#### **AI-Powered Suggestions**:
The system provides intelligent recommendations based on crowd density:

| Count Range | Status | Color Code | Suggestion |
|------------|--------|-----------|------------|
| 0-10 people | Available | 🟢 Green | "Mess is free! Perfect time to eat." |
| 11-20 people | Moderate | 🟠 Orange | "Moderately full. You might have to wait." |
| 20+ people | Crowded | 🔴 Red | "Very Crowded! Do not enter." |

#### **Firebase Synchronization**:
- Updates every **5 seconds** to Firebase Realtime Database
- Data structure:
  ```json
  {
    "Mess-System": {
      "hall-1": {
        "name": "Main Mess",
        "count": 15,
        "status": "Moderate"
      },
      "best_suggestion": {
        "message": "Moderately full. You might have to wait.",
        "color": "orange"
      },
      "last_updated": 1704825600
    }
  }
  ```

#### **Live Dashboard**:
